            <p class="thin">  <span class="firstcharacter">I</span>taly is a democratic country and, as such, it ensures fundamental human rights. Among these, the freedom of information. But how can information be free in a country where basically a journalist is threatened every day because of his/her job? Where is such an alarming data rooted, and which is its real scope? Italy enjoys media pluralism, that’s for sure, but is freedom of information actually guaranteed? 
<br />
Most of the 324 journalists threatened in 2012 alone are young, forcibly independent, with temporary contracts. The system is not able to protect journalists professionally, let alone physically. Therefore intimidations are also used as a means of preventive censorship. 

But sunshine is the best disinfectant and may ease the plague of Italy’s information system, by favouring a conscious and collective response to intimidation resulting from threatening letters by local gangsters and legal actions by respectable lawyers alike. Plus assaults, arsons, malicious mischief. 
<br />
A response calling for awareness and the firm action of each responsible stakeholder, which not always live up to roles and expectations: from journalistic to state bodies, from politics to civil society, including journalists themselves. 
<br />
The observatory Ossigeno per l’Informazione (oxygen for information) has been carefully monitoring the phenomenon of journalists under threat for years. In its annual reports Ossigeno sheds a light on an obscure, insidious, overloooked situation. An iceberg whose underwater portion is hard to define “since one of the aim of those who threaten journalists is simply conceal such violence and abuse from the public eye, as they would be less effective if they were made public”.  </p>
